# S-M-Fluorescence-Model

Kinetic model used to perform simulations for the Investigation of the slow phase of chlorophyll a fluorescence induction in silico: the origin of the slow S-M fluorescence rise by Alexandrina Stirbet1  and Govindjee.

## The Model
The model was built using Mathematica, based on the dynamic model of the electron transport chain published by Ebenh√∂h et al. (DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2013.0223), available in the executable form in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/QTB-HHU/petcmodel. 

It consists of differential equations and all necessary reaction rates, ODEs and parameters are included in the Excell file: L100afterD200.xlsx
